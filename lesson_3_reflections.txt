When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you making a project probably you have a group of people who are you working with, remote repository makes your cooperation much easir because all of you can track changes in this project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Probably when you making a stable version of new feature or project it would be better to push/pull only when it will be comfortable for you, manual push/pull requests keep your projects clean and logical.
